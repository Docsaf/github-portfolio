**Dr. Safi Mojidi - Executive "Defensive Coordinator" | Security Strategist | Infrastructure Resilience**

I translate digital governance, cyber risk, and infrastructure resilience into actionable playbooks. As a former professional athlete turned security executive, I help leaders turn disruption into a full-court press of durable security. I secure every organizational layer, bridging board-level strategy with concrete technical controls.

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. I bridge the gap between risk, compliance, technical engineering and executive strategy, helping organizations build secure, resilient, and compliant cloud-native environments. My expertise lies in converting engineering-led practices into auditable, product-grade security programs, focusing on corporate cybersecurity strategy and robust enterprise infrastructure.

**👨🏽‍💻 The Player Profile 💪🏾**

I bring Olympic-level discipline and "Hall of Fame" grit to every team I lead. My career is a testament to the "Builder-Defender" mindset, evolving from the forensic trenches to the executive boardroom.

The Foundation (NASA HQ): My career began in Computer Forensics and Incident Response at NASA Headquarters. It was here, investigating incidents, that I learned early on that effective defense is a community sport.

The Front Lines (USAF): I served as a Base Security Officer at an Air Force Base in California. This role placed me at the forefront of national security, providing fertile ground to master the breadth and depth of physical and digital defense.

The Return (Cloud Strategy): I couldn't stay out of orbit. I returned to NASA for an 8-year tenure to build a fully virtual office setting the standard for Public Cloud usage. I led the team entrusted to develop security compliance and engineering in a "sky full of cloud providers," becoming an integral advisor to the Agency CIO on baseline risk appetite.

The Big Wins: Leveraging this federal experience, I supported Slack/Salesforce during their $27.7B acquisition and led ransomware recovery efforts for state and local governments.

**Education:**
D.Sc. in Cybersecurity | Marymount University

M.S. in Information Assurance and Security | Capella University

Graduate Certificate: Digital Forensics | University of Maryland Global Campus

B.S. in Computer Science | University of Rhode Island

With over 15+ years of experience leading secure cloud migrations and threat detection programs for critical infrastructure and government sectors, I bring a unique "builder-defender" perspective. I've contributed to the security due diligence for Salesforce's $25B acquisition of Slack and achieved SOC 2 readiness that unlocked major healthcare partnerships for telehealth companies.

Currently, I serve as an Adjunct Professor at Marymount University, where I teach the next generation of cybersecurity professionals to think like architects and strategists. We are learning about Corporate Cybersecurity Strategy, Enterprise Architecture & Networks, Cloud Security, GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance), Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

**MyTeaching Philosophy:** "The textbook is a lie. The real world is messy. We build before we break."

**📚What's Included in my Repositories**

I use GitHub to host lab materials, configuration files, and resources for the projects complete and courses I teach.
